# A custom environment EnergyOptimizationEnv is created by inheriting from gym.Env.
# The action_space and observation_space are defined to represent possible actions and observable states in the environment, respectively.
# The step function is where the main logic for applying actions and updating the environment's state is located, along with calculating the reward and checking if the episode is complete.
# The reset method is used to initialize or reset the environment to a starting state.
# This simulation environment, as part of the EnergyOptimization project, can be used for developing and testing various reinforcement learning algorithms for energy optimization strategies.
